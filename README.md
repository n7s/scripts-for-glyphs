# scripts-for-glyphs

Just a few python scripts (tools) to use with the Glyphs font editor (macOS-only).  
A learning experience for me and simple workflow helpers for Glyphs users.

Various snippets are taken/reinterpreted/inspired from the Glyphs docs or from the Glyphs forum.  

Simply drop the files into ~/Library/Application Support/Glyphs/Scripts/n7s-scripts  
Some scripts require other python modules.

Enjoy.
