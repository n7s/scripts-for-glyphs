# scripts-for-glyphs

Just a few python scripts (tools) to use with the Glyphs font editor (macOS-only).  
A learning experience for me and simple workflow helpers for Glyphs users.

Various snippets are taken/reinterpreted/inspired from the Glyphs docs or from the Glyphs forum.  

Simply drop the files into ~/Library/Application Support/Glyphs/Scripts/n7s-scripts  
Then in Glyphs, hold Alt and go to Scripts->Reload Scripts. The various scripts then appear in submenus under Scripts.
(Some scripts require other python modules).

Enjoy.
